## Go Test

``` 
Underutilized testing strategy: test your log output. This forces you to do several things you should be doing anyway:

- Loggers are dependencies, not globals
- Routable log output (to in-mem buffers)
- Well-defined log schemas (structured logging)
- Deterministic components

Testing log output can also be a good proxy for asserting internal state/behavior, 
without having to get your unit test dirty by poking at private data.

Itâ€™s worth clarifying that testing log output should be, at most, just part of your overall testing breakfast.

Another handy tip is to check `testing.Verbose()` and use `io.MultiWriter` to send logs to `os.Stderr` and your in-memory buffer so you can debug logs with the `go test -v` flag.
